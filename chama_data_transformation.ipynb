Some information about App usage is generated by our App and our backend API. Other sources of information, like the Google Play Store, can provide very useful insights on App performance and user rating. Chama is very data-oriented and, most decisions are made based on appropriate metrics, therefore, data quality is a must and a concern of everyone involved."
